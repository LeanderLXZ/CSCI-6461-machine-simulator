The University Writing Center has four satellite locations. In addition to our main center at Gelman Library. These are
Himmelfarb Library, Eckles Library on the Mount Vernon campus, Innovation Hall on the Ashburn Campus, and the
Multicultural Student Services Center. All writing consultation conferences are free to members of the GW community.
Although appointments are not required and drop-ins are welcome. We also do recommend that you reserve a time slot as the
Writing Center's appointments do tend to fill up quickly.
